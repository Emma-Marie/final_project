# Has the danish funerary practize been secularized?

##Motivation##  
This project investigates the developement in civil funerals from 2006-2021 and compare the trend in civil funerals with the amount of funerals in the danish national church and in other religions & freechurches. Funerals both mirror and shape the way people interpret and cope with death and how professionals such as nurses and social health care assistants take care of the dying and the mourning. If the funerals are brought into a new (non)religious framework, the way people understand and cope with death and loss will change, and so will the conversation about death and grief, and the way professionals have to talk about death and grief with the dying and the mourning (Walter 2015, 133).

**Software**: 
To run the script you need to install RStudio. I used the version RStudio-2022.12.0-535. 
The project is made on my MacBook Air (2015) computer that runs macOS Monterey (12.5.1).

**Before starting**:
Clone the repository `final_project` to your computer to get all the data, the script, the figures etc. The repository can be found on my Github here: https://github.com/Emma-Marie/final_project 

**Data**: 
The data set is found on danmarksstatistik.dk. The data can be found here: final_project/data/funerals_messy.csv

**Script**: 
The main purpose of the script is to vizualise the trends in danish funeral types. In the script the data from Danmarks Statistik is cleaned and vizualised with ggplot2. 

**Packages needed**: 
`tidyverse`
`readxl`
`dplyr`
`ggplot2`

I hope you will have a good time investigating danish funerals with me!
